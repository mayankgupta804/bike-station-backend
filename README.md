# bike-station-backend

This project is inspired by this [awesome blog](https://www.oreilly.com/content/how-to-design-a-restful-api-architecture-from-a-human-language-spec/) on designing REST APIs.

A WIP mostly meant for learning how to create a good overall design for a RESTful API service in Clojure.
